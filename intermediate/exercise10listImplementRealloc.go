/*
  Improve your previous implementation such that an arbitrary number of elements
   can be stored in your list. You can for example allocate bigger and bigger
   chunks of memory as your list grows, copy the old elements over and release
   the old storage. You should probably also release this memory eventually
   if your list shrinks enough not to need it anymore. //"should probably" -> no
  Think about how much bigger the new chunk of memory should be so that your
   performance wonâ€™t be killed by allocations.
  Increasing the size by 1 element for example is a bad idea.
